# HighLow Game

## Introduction
The HighLow game is a fun, interactive Python-based guessing game where players are challenged to determine which of two options has a greater number of social media followers. Utilizing custom data alongside art assets, this game employs various Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and functions, to provide an engaging gaming experience.

## How to Play

1. At the beginning of the game, players are presented with two personalities, each with their own follower count.
2. The player's task is to guess which personality has more followers on social media.
3. For every correct guess, the player earns a point, and the game continues with a new pair of personalities.
4. The game concludes when the player's guess is incorrect, and their final score is displayed.
